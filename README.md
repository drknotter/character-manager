D&amp;D Character Manager
=================

I wrote this app when I was frequently playing D&D (4th edition) and shuffling around pages and pages of powers, abilities, skills, etc. for my character. I coded this as a Chrome extension. The app reads .dnd4e files (generated from the online WOTC character generator) from the local data/ directory, and displays the information in collapsible, tidy boxes, along with functionality for keeping track of current HP, number of healing surges, status effects, etc. Coded entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the [d3](http://d3js.org/) library.
